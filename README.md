# Task 1
<details>
<summary> Task 1: Summation Program in C on Ubuntu

This task demonstrates writing, compiling, and executing a C program to calculate the summation of numbers from 1 to `n`. The program was executed in an Ubuntu environment, and additional configurations for RISC-V compilation were explored.

## Steps Performed

### 1. **Installing Text Editor (`leafpad`)**
- Attempted to open a file using the `leafpad` text editor.
- The command `leafpad` was not found, so it was installed using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install leafpad

### 2. **Write the C program***
```bash
  leafpad sum1ton.c
```

### 3.Compile and run the program:
```bash
gcc sum1ton.c
./a.out
```
### 4.Cross-compile for RISC-V:
-Install riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc.
-Use the following command to compile:
```bash
 riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```
-Verify the object file:
```bash
ls -ltr sum1ton.o
```

# Task 2:
<details>
  <summary> Task 2: Spike Simulation

-This repository provides a detailed demonstration of compiling and simulating C code for the RISC-V architecture using the RISC-V GCC compiler and SPIKE simulator. It specifically focuses on comparing the performance of compiled programs with different compiler optimization flags (-O1 and -Ofast).
</summary>

### Objective
- Understand how to compile a simple C program for the RISC-V architecture.
- Use RISC-V GCC to compile the program with different optimization levels (-O1 and -Ofast).
- Analyze the performance of the program using the SPIKE simulator.
- Compare the assembly output and program execution flow with different optimization levels.

###  Compile Using RISC-V GCC
- The C program is compiled using the riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc compiler. The target architecture is rv64i (64-bit RISC-V) and the ABI is lp64.

- Compile with -O1 Optimization:
To compile with basic optimization (-O1), use the following command:
```bash
 riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o swift.o swift.c
```
### Disassemble Object File:
- To view the assembly code generated by the compiler, use the following command:
 ```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d swift.o
```
- We can also minimize the output for easier reading:
  ```bash
   riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d swift.o | less

### Run SPIKE Simulation
- To simulate the compiled RISC-V program in non-debug mode, use the following command:
  ```bash
  spike pk swift.o
```
